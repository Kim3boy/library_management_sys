# Instructions to Compile and Run the Program

## Prerequisites
- Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., `g++`).
- Make sure you have the necessary permissions to execute commands in your terminal.

## Steps to Compile
1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the source files:
    ```sh
    cd /home/kod3x/Documents/assignment_oop/new/library_management_sys
    ```
3. Compile the program using the following command:
    ```sh
    g++ -o library_management_sys main.cpp
    ```

## Steps to Run
1. After successful compilation, run the program with:
    ```sh
    ./library_management_sys
    ```

## Steps to Run Tests
1. Ensure you have a testing framework installed (e.g., `Catch2` for C++).
2. Compile the test files using the following command:
    ```sh
    g++ -o test_library_management_sys test_main.cpp
    ```
3. Run the test executable with:
    ```sh
    ./test_library_management_sys
    ```

## Notes
- Ensure all dependencies and libraries are properly included in your source files.
- If you encounter any errors, check the error messages for guidance on resolving them.
